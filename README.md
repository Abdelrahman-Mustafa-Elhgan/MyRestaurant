🍔 MyRestaurant

📄 Description  
A simple C++ program that simulates a restaurant food ordering and billing system. Users can select items, input quantities, apply automatic discounts, choose delivery options, and receive a detailed receipt—all through a console-based interface.

✨ Features  
✅ Interactive food menu (Burger, Pizza, Fries, Drink)  
✅ Quantity input for each item  
✅ Automatic 10% discount if more than 3 of the same item  
✅ Optional delivery with a fixed fee  
✅ Tax calculation (14%)  
✅ Payment method selection (cash/card)  
✅ Final receipt with itemized details and total amount  

💡 Example  
User selects food items → Enters quantities → Chooses whether to continue ordering → Applies discount and tax → Optionally adds delivery → Selects payment method → Program prints the receipt.

🎯 Purpose  
This project helps beginners practice:

- `do-while` loops for repeated input  
- `switch-case` structures for menu logic  
- Arithmetic calculations and discounts  
- Basic use of boolean and string variables  
- Input/output formatting using `setprecision()`  
- Interactive console-based applications in C++

🛠️ Technologies  
- C++ Programming Language  
- Standard Input/Output (`iostream`, `iomanip`)
